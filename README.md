# snow-crash - A 42 school project

## Methodology

When we first begin a level we'll first look into who we are
>whoami

>id

Where we are
>pwd

>ls -l

What we have access to

>find / -user <us> 2>/dev/null

>find / -name "*<us>" 2>/dev/null

>sudo -l

What the goal has access to

>find / -user <target> 2>/dev/null

>find / -name "*<target>" 2>/dev/null
